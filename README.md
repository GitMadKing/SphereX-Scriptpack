## Naming conventions
### Filenames
The prefix "sphere_" was left only for the basic scripts, without which Sphere can't work or can't provide its most basic features.
Files without this prefix are still needed but fundamentally optional, since not absolutely required for Sphere to work.

## ToDo
* Test map1 locations (is every teleport and area correct?)
* Add missing Stygian Abyss monsters, all High sea and TOL monsters
* Update sphere_backwards_compatibility. Rename spk_horse, human, master to a more specific name (and change it to a job_*)
